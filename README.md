Made for [fx(hash)](https://fxhash.xyz)'s 
[fx(hackathon)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/events/fxhackathon-2023:-co-creation-interfaces/onboarding)  

This is a WIP Generative Token. The objective is to provide a minting 
interface in which the minter will create a profile like a RPG, which 
will give the starting parameters for a genetic algorithm in the 
minted token, through fx(params). That genetic algorithm will in turn 
produce a generative art which should reflect the decisions taken in 
the minting phase.
